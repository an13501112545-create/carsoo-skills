# Carsoo Skills Registry

This repo stores "skills" that carsoo-bot can learn and execute.

## Conventions
- Each skill lives in its own folder:
  skills/<skill_name>/
    - SKILL.md (how to use)
    - manifest.json (inputs/outputs/permissions)
    - entrypoint script (tool.ts or tool.py)

## First skill: hello_skill
See ./hello_skill/SKILL.md
